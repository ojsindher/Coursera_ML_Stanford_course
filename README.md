# Coursera_ML_Stanford_course
These are the _programming assignments_ from **Machine Learning** course offered by **Standford** on the Coursera platform, where it is taught by leading data science expert **Andrew Ng**. 

The code files are suitable for **MATLAB** or **Octave**. Feel free to check out my solution if you are stuck in any of the exercises, though copying it directly for your assingments can result in cancellation of your Coursera account as per their policy.
